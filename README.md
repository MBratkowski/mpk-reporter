# mpk_reporter

This is an open-source, not an official app to send information about incidents in public transport in Wroclaw.

The idea which stays behind this application is that - current socials applications (especially Facebook) are not adjusted for this kind of needs.

We want to improve the quality of public transport in Wroclaw city, so we want to create tools which will be good for passengers.

Flutter will be enough to deliver MVP of this product for both platforms - iOS and Android.
